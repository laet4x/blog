During my enumeration we got a field which you can submit via form then another page which is login portal

I submit a test content and we got this:

This a message  that give me a hint of possible XSS attack to get an Admin Cookies, and yes I send a crafted xss payload to get the admin cookies. Gotcha!

I install a cookie editor to use the session came from the results of my XSS attack.

Then I redirected to the admin panel and I dont see any field or upload files, just the ticket that I submitted, then I check the links and I found a change password field.

I notice that the account that I compromised is a moderator, Im thinking that there is an Admin account for this application.
I enable the inspect element functions of browser to check a hidden fields, then I found a UID.

I decided to edit the value to 1 and supplied my chosen password and click submit, then I  got this message

I login using admin and my chosen password and automatically redirected to Home Page with a Flag

Conclusion: We able to get the flag since the application are vulnerable to Persistent XSS and IDOR or known as Insicure Direct Object Reference
