This a message give me a hit of possible XSS attack to get an Admin Cookies, and yes i send a crafted xss payload to get the admin cookies. Gotcha!

I install a cookie editor to use the session came from the results of my XSS attack.

The i redirected to the admin panel and i dont see any field or upload files, just the ticket that i submitted, then i check the links and i found a change password field.

I notice that the account that i compromised is a moderator, Im thinking that there an Admin account for this application.
I enable the inspect element functions of browser to check a hidden fields, then i found a UID.

I decided to edit the value to 1 and supplied my chosen password and click submit, then i got this message

I login using admin and my chosen password and automatically redirected to Home Page with a Flag

Conclusion: We able to get the flag since the application are vulnerable to Persistent XSS and IDOR or known as Insicure Direct Object Reference
